# 🎼 Full Score - Web's Native Analytics

<br />

## Preface: When Will the Next Web Technology Appear?

Web technology today faces a paradox. Tools get heavier while insights diminish. Data explodes while privacy regulations tighten. AI claims to understand everything, yet data remains in forms AI struggles to read.

Web technology has been a history of addition. More features, more data, more layers of saturation. The result? We load megabytes of analytics and security scripts, manage dozens of servers, and battle endlessly expanding complexity.

Full Score chose a different path. With less than 7KB of code, here's how to create real-time web interaction analytics and security layers.

<br />

## First Movement: Web Interactions Become Music

### Events on a Timeline

Web interactions are essentially an Aria on the G String. Every action—arriving at a page, browsing, clicking, leaving—happens on a timeline. This is exactly the same structure as notes placed on a timeline in music.

The name Full Score symbolizes a musical score or composition. Just as a full score captures every moment of a performance, Full Score captures all web interactions in one system.

### Three Independent Yet Harmonious Technologies

Full Score consists of three independent technologies. Each is useful alone, yet more powerful together.

**TEMPO (Tap Event Method Performance Optimizer)** is a 50-line snippet that improves tap event speed and accuracy. Like an orchestra conductor synchronizing different instruments' tempos, it harmonizes mobile and desktop interactions. Without offbeats, every touch and click completes as a single note. While it provides immediate improvements standalone, when used with RHYTHM, it becomes a gateway for collecting user interaction data.

**RHYTHM (Real-time Hybrid Traffic History Monitor)** is a client-side engine that leverages users' browsers like auxiliary databases. Unlike traditional approaches that send, store, and process data on servers, it embeds core functionality in the browser. Connected with Edge Computing, it enables real-time analysis and immediate response without server intervention. It proposes a new paradigm with minimal data transfer costs, server operation costs, and processing delays.

**BEAT (Behavioral Event Analytics Transform)** is a domain-specific language (DSL) that serializes 3D behavioral data—time (X), action (Y), and depth (Z)—into linear sequences. It compresses complex user journeys into single strings, written to be readable by both humans and AI. While it's RHYTHM's core data format, it has versatility for use in other systems.

These three technologies are like a jazz trio—each solo performance is excellent, but together they create true harmony.

<br />

## Second Movement: TEMPO - The Piano Tuner's Gift

### Two Different Instruments

Desktop clicks are like playing an electric piano. Press a key, sound comes instantly. Electrical signals travel to speakers without delay, and performers experience their intentions becoming music directly.

```
User click → mousedown → mouseup → click
```

Mobile touches are like playing a grand piano. Press a key, and hammers move, strike strings, dampers open—a complex mechanical process. The system must interpret the touch's intent. Was it a light tap? A scroll attempt? A zoom gesture? Time is needed to determine.

```
User touch → touchstart → [touchmove]* → touchend → [event loop] → click
```

### Accumulation of Micro-Delays

The notorious 300ms delay in mobile browsers gradually disappeared in 2013. But micro-delays from event loops persist. Sometimes touches feel imprecise.

```javascript
// At touch end
touchend fires (T+0ms)
    ↓
// Added to event queue  
Click event added to task queue (T+1ms estimate)
    ↓
// Wait for current code to complete
JavaScript execution stack must clear (T+5ms estimate)
    ↓
// Next event loop turn
Event loop pulls click event from queue (T+15ms estimate)
    ↓
// Click handler executes
finally, click event processed (T+16ms estimate)
```

16ms seems small, but it's one frame at 60fps. Like a sixteenth note arriving late in music. One or two go unnoticed, but rapid sequences break the rhythm.

WebView environments are more complex. In-app browsers like Instagram or X pass through additional layers.

```
Native app layer
    ↓ (bridge communication ?ms)
WebView layer
    ↓ (event conversion ?ms)
JavaScript layer
    ↓ (event loop ?ms)
Final click processing
```

Through these complex layers, touch responsiveness degrades further. As touches accumulate, erroneous events can pile up. In severe cases, touches become completely unresponsive. Like a piano on a humid day—keys that won't press or won't return.

### TEMPO's Tuning

TEMPO, like a piano tuner, standardizes every key's depth and response. It strives to create beautifully matched tempo across both desktop and mobile.

```javascript
// Traditional: Asynchronous chain
touchend → [queue] → [loop] → [wait] → click

// TEMPO: Direct execution
touchend → el.click()  // Synchronous immediate execution!
```

This simple tuning creates meaningful effects. Touches now bypass the event loop and execute immediately. Complex event handling logic becomes unnecessary.

Even when DOM changes rapidly—like ad banners or lazy-loading UIs—post-touch delays disappear, improving accuracy.

But browsers still generate native clicks at their own tempo. TEMPO handles this offbeat elegantly.

```javascript
// The Phantom of the Opera trap
let once = true;
const block = (ev) => {
    if (once && ev.isTrusted) {          // Real browser-generated event
        ev.preventDefault();              // Block default action
        ev.stopImmediatePropagation();   // Stop propagation
        once = false;                    // Block only once
        document.removeEventListener("click", block, true);  // Remove listener
        pending.delete(block);            // Remove from Set
    }
};
```

Like pressing the damper pedal at the perfect moment to eliminate unwanted resonance, TEMPO silently absorbs duplicate clicks.

### A 50-Line Score

TEMPO's entire code fits within 50 lines. Like Bach's Inventions, it creates music with minimal notes.

```javascript
function tempo(rhythm) { // Tap Event Method Performance Optimizer
    if (document.tempo) return;
    document.tempo = true;
    if ("ontouchstart" in window || navigator.maxTouchPoints > 0) { // Mobile environment detection
        const pending = new Set(); // Track pending native click blockers
        let moved = false;
        document.addEventListener("touchstart", () => (moved = false, pending.forEach(b => document.removeEventListener("click", b, true)), pending.clear()), {capture: true, passive: true}); // Reset moved
        document.addEventListener("touchmove", () => moved = true, {capture: true, passive: true}); // Mark as moved
        document.addEventListener("touchcancel", () => moved = true, {capture: true, passive: true}); // Mark as cancelled
        document.addEventListener("touchend", (e) => {

            // if (e.target.closest(".nofasttouch")) return; // Uncomment to exclude specific elements

            if (moved || !e.changedTouches?.[0]) return; // Skip if moved or no touch
            let once = true;
            const block = (ev) => { // Block native click once
                if (once && ev.isTrusted) {
                    ev.preventDefault();
                    ev.stopImmediatePropagation();
                    once = false;
                    document.removeEventListener("click", block, true);
                    pending.delete(block);
                }
            };
            pending.add(block);
            document.addEventListener("click", block, {capture: true}); // Register blocker
            let t = document.elementFromPoint(e.changedTouches[0].clientX, e.changedTouches[0].clientY); // Get target at touch point
            const label = t?.closest('label');
            t = label?.control || label?.querySelector('input,textarea,select,button') || t; // Label to control redirect
            rhythm && (t = rhythm.click(t, e)); // RHYTHM integration, null blocks click
            if (t) for (let i = 0; i < 8; i++) { // Find clickable parent, max 8 levels
                if (typeof t.click === "function") {t.click(); break;} // Native click method
                if (t.onclick) {t.dispatchEvent(new MouseEvent("click", {bubbles: true, cancelable: true})); break;} // Onclick handler
                if (!(t = t.parentElement)) break; // Move to parent or exit
            }
        }, {capture: true, passive: true});
    } else if (rhythm) { // Desktop environment detection
        let used = false; // Gesture already used
        document.addEventListener("mousedown", () => used = false, {capture: true}); // Reset on mouse down
        document.addEventListener("keydown", e => !e.repeat && (e.key === "Enter" || e.key === " ") && (used = false), {capture: true}); // Reset on Enter/Space
        document.addEventListener("click", e => {
            if (used) return; // Skip if already used
            used = true, rhythm.click(e.target.closest('label')?.control || e.target, e); // Process once, label to control redirect
        }, {capture: true});
    }
}

// tempo(); // Uncomment for standalone use
```

Each line performs a precise role. At touch or click start, it clears echoes from previous performances. It detects movement to distinguish scrolls from taps. At the end, it finds the exact element and executes the click. Special handling for Label elements adds accessibility harmony, and the 8-level fallback ensures the performance continues in any situation.

These 50 lines synchronize tempo across all devices. Like a perfectly tuned concert grand.

<br />

## Third Movement: RHYTHM - Music in the Browser

### A Paradigm Shift

Traditional web analytics is complex like a massive symphony. Instruments for collecting data, transmitting data, storing data, processing data—all playing separately. Each part operates independently, requiring enormous time and cost just to tune them.

RHYTHM is like a singer-songwriter's creative process. Starting composition in a quiet room, building melodies note by note on staff paper to complete a Full Score. Then taking that score to the streets to perform freely. The browser becomes the chosen stage, with no interruptions.

### The Browser and Cookie Stage

Browsers have various storage options. LocalStorage boasts concert hall capacity but complex setup. SessionStorage is intimate like a live house but only open for a day. IndexedDB is glamorous like an opera house but has demanding entry procedures.

The cookie RHYTHM chose is like street busking. All you need is one small stage. No fancy lights or sound equipment required. But there's one crucial feature: whenever you want, you can livestream your performance in real-time. Your reliable friend and manager, Edge Computing, helps with the livestreaming.

```javascript
document.cookie = `rhythm_01=${data}; Max-Age=259200; Path=/rhythm`;
// Max-Age=259200 = Auto-delete after 3 days (actual RHYTHM.AGE value in code)
```

Like busking that leaves no trace when finished, cookies delete themselves after a few days. No performance permits needed, no teardown requests. Like the city's rhythm, it naturally begins and ends.

### RHYTHM Created by Data

RHYTHM stores session data like a melody composed of notes on a staff. Each note carries unique meaning.

```javascript
const rhythm_01 = {
    ping: 0,            // Performance start (0) or end (1)
    security: 0,        // Performance volume (0-100, too loud risks noise complaints)
    addon: 0,           // Special performance equipment (0=none, 1-255=amps, lights, etc.)
    device: 0,          // Instrument type (0=electric keyboard, 1=acoustic guitar, 2=drums)
    referrer: 1,        // Performance spot (0=home street, 1=regular spot, 2=new venue, 3-255=special venues)
    time: 1735680000,   // Performance start time
    duration: 300,      // Performance duration
    clicks: 45,         // Guitar strings plucked (audience engagement)
    scrolls: 23,        // Engagement prompts (passersby who stopped)
    beat: "!home~10*1"  // Performance record (BEAT format)
//  custom: Users can freely adjust RHYTHM field formats to match their performance style
}
```

When stored in cookies, this data becomes a single line of sheet music separated by underscores (_).

```
"0_0_0_0_1_1735680000_300_45_23_!home~10*1"
```

A single line expresses an entire session. If JSON is conducting each orchestra section, RHYTHM is as concise as playing guitar tabs.

### Livestreaming with Edge Computing

Edge is the singer-songwriter's reliable companion, an indispensable friend. When the singer-songwriter performs their RHYTHM, Edge livestreams it to the world.

```javascript
export default {
    async fetch(request) {
        const cookies = request.headers.get('Cookie') || '';
        const rhythmPattern = /rhythm_(\d{2})=([^;]+)/g;
        let premium = false;

        for (const match of cookies.matchAll(rhythmPattern)) {
            const parts = match[2].split('_');
            const security  = Number(parts[1]); // Bot score (0~100)
            const duration  = Math.max(Number(parts[6]), 1);
            const clicks    = Number(parts[7]);
            const scrolls   = Number(parts[8]);

            // If bot, stop performance and request ban
            if (security > 80) 
                return new Response('Bot Detected', { status: 403 });

            // Scout passionate singer-songwriters for pro debut
            const engagement = (clicks + scrolls) / duration;
            if (engagement > 2) { premium = true; break; }
        }

        if (premium) {
            const headers = new Headers(request.headers);
            headers.set('X-User-Segment', 'premium');
            request = new Request(request, { headers });
        }

        return fetch(request);
    }
}
```

Every decision is analyzed in milliseconds through Edge's livestreaming. Edge simply reads and analyzes cookies already included in users' standard HTTP requests in real-time. No data endpoints required.

No separate analytics servers or central database queries needed. Browser and Edge connect closely in spacetime like sympathetic resonance—fast and vivid. Processing delays are imperceptibly low.

A traditional concert hall would be different. Without complex broadcast equipment, without separate studios, street music spreads worldwide.

### Session Management

Singer-songwriters can manage multiple sessions simultaneously. For smooth performances, we recommend limiting to rhythm_01 through rhythm_06. New sessions are created when cookies fill up or when switching browser tabs.

Limiting to 6 sessions prevents audience confusion from constantly changing setlists during one performance. Exceeding this number suggests noise pollution rather than pure busking—likely a bot signal.

Edge also has limits. Famous CDN/edge networks typically set header size limits at 8~32KB. While sufficient for streaming 4KB cookie sessions, too many sessions risk disconnection. When performances run too long, livestreaming stops at the singer-songwriter's signal (ping=1). The performance data archives privately, then new streaming begins. This circular structure enables practically unlimited performances.

Edge is a good friend who asks for no compensation for management activities, but may grumble and request small rewards if livestreaming restarts too frequently.

### Performance Techniques

Subdomains allow more generous header transmission. But even passionate hour-long performances rarely fill 4KB with BEAT notation. Not recommended.

RHYTHM turns users' browser cookies into small personal storage. With 100 million users, it's like having 100 million auxiliary databases. Browsers provide isolated execution environments at the user level, operating directly on devices with no perceptible delay. For even more speed, HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 environments are recommended. Cookies become lighter by reusing values registered in compression tables.

### Stage Beginning and End

Ping signals the performance's start and end. 0 means the singer-songwriter takes the stage to begin performing, 1 means ending the performance and leaving the stage.

When the singer-songwriter finishes a wonderful performance and leaves the stage, Edge detects ping=1 and ends livestreaming. Today's performance—recording nothing but pure rhythm without IP or names—archives privately or disappears as a one-time performance remaining only briefly in people's memories.

<br />

## Fourth Movement: BEAT - Actions Become Performance

### Format for Recording User Actions

BEAT expresses user actions like a performance. Like recording an entire live performance on video.

```
!home~300*3input1~1200!1~50*1
```

Listen to the story this short performance tells. A user takes the homepage (!home) stage, searches for products after 30 seconds of silence (*3input1). After enjoying content for 120 seconds, they modulate to the first mapped page (!1). Then in 5 seconds, they reach the climax—the purchase button (*1).

### Grammar Recording Flow Like Musical Notes

BEAT records performance order as follows:

**Pages (!) - Moments of changing songs**
- !home: Overture (homepage, only reserved word)
- !x3n, !x3n4k: Songs designated by 3-5 character auto-generated hashes
- !en, !product: Other songs directly chosen by performer (user-mapped pages)

**Elements (*) - Note pitch**
- *3nav1: Plucking guitar's third string with first stroke (DOM depth + element type + index)
- *6button2: Plucking guitar's sixth string with second stroke
- *close, *modal: Special chords designated by composer (user-mapped elements)

**Time (~) - Rests and beats**
- ~10: 1 second of breath
- ~250: 25 seconds of meditation
- .10.20.30: RHYTHM repetition (repeat times separated by dots)

### Automatic Hash Generation and Mapping

Pre-mapping every page is difficult. BEAT generates automatic hashes using a lightweight hash algorithm (DJB2).

```javascript
function hashPage(pathname) {
    if (pathname === '/') return '!home';
    
    let hash = 5381;
    for (let i = 0; i < pathname.length; i++) {
        hash = ((hash << 5) + hash) + pathname.charCodeAt(i);
        hash = hash >>> 0;  // unsigned 32-bit
    }
    
    const limit = pathname.length <= 7 ? 3 : pathname.length <= 14 ? 4 : 5;
    return '!' + hash.toString(36).substring(0, limit);
}
```

Examples:
- `/about` → `!x3n` (3-character hash)
- `/products` → `!a2b4` (4-character hash)
- `/products/laptop` → `!x3n4k` (5-character hash)

Users can compress BEAT further by mapping frequently visited pages and important elements.

```javascript
// Page mapping
const pageMap = {
    '/products': '!prod',
    '/cart': '!cart',
    '/checkout': '!pay'
};

// Element mapping
const elementMap = {
    '.add-to-cart': '*add',
    '.buy-now': '*buy',
    '#search-button': '*search'
};
```

Mapping effects:
- `/products/laptop/dell-xps-15` → `!prod` (35 chars → 5 chars)
- `.product-grid > button.add-to-cart` → `*add` (36 chars → 4 chars)

### Aesthetics of Compression and Harmonics of Depth

BEAT's compression is like musical abbreviation. Repeated themes are written once with variations noted.

```javascript
// Regular
~100*button~150*button~200*button

// BEAT abbreviation
~100.150.200*button
```

This compression reduces hour-long sessions to about 1KB of sheet music. If JSON is classical notation requiring understanding of complex tonal relationships, BEAT is tab notation surrendering to simple flow.

Yet DOM depth inherent in BEAT is rich like musical depth (octaves). Multiple strings and frets must harmonize for rich resonance, but repeating the same note doesn't sound like performance.

It's as if JSON places individual notes as dots, while BEAT connects those dots into melody. Despite maximum compression, the music within remains clear.

```
Human performance: *15span2, *12div3, *8button1 (deep, rich harmony)
Bot noise: *1a1, *1a2, *1a3, *1a4 (monotonous surface strikes)
```

Real purchase buttons usually hide 8 layers deep. Real users start with the overture and gradually go deeper, while bots only tap the surface.

BEAT is a domain-specific language (DSL) that layers time, action, and depth in the browser. Users can extend it variously as desired.

```javascript
// Default
!home~300*3input1~1200!page~50*button

// Example 1: Format change only
@home>300#3input1>1200@page>50#button

// Example 2: Add scroll events (^ records scroll position - can be enabled in BEAT)
!home^1200~300*3input1~1200!page^2400~50*button 

// Example 3: Shorter abbreviation (1-second units, minimized action symbols, precise mapping)
!~30*2~120!1~5*1
```

Despite these various possibilities, BEAT considers the default most ideal. Here's why:

### AI and Human Duet

BEAT defines a coordinate system of time (X), action (Y), and depth (Z), serializing this 3D behavioral data into linear sequences. It converts multidimensional logs into single strings that can be directly input into sequence models.

```
Human: "!home~300*3input1~1200!page~50*button"

AI: "A user starting at home (!home) searches for products after 30 seconds (*3input1).
     After spending 120 seconds reviewing, they navigate to the product detail page (!page).
     Then decide to purchase in just 5 seconds (*button). Classic purposeful buyer pattern."
```

Just as tab notation captures 6 lines of information on a flat surface, BEAT captures 3D behavioral data in a 1D string. AI immediately decodes this compressed 3D information to understand user intent.

The advantage of serialized linear sequences is their language-like structure requiring no interpretation. Unlike JSON's nested structures, BEAT reads straight through, relatively safe from parsing errors or structural ambiguity.

What matters is that with simple rules, AI immediately interprets. With just 3 rules—! for pages, ~ for time, * for elements—AI understands !home~300*3input1 as "search after 30 seconds at home."

While BEAT falls within domain-specific languages (DSL), its characteristic of being readable by both humans and AI suggests it's a new type of behavioral recording language.

BEAT's recommended default uses only cookie-safe characters. This 100% complies with RFC 6265 standards, passing safely through Edge and other security barriers.

No encoding/decoding process needed, with 60-75% compression versus JSON expected. 100 bytes of JSON abbreviates to about 30 bytes of BEAT.

This means 50x smaller total data volume compared to traditional analytics, enabling real-time analysis without delays in both browsers and Edge.

<br />

## Fifth Movement: System Integration and Practice

### The Singer-Songwriter's Creative Process

Full Score's three elements are like a singer-songwriter building skill, composing original music, and performing for people.

1. **TEMPO (Practice)** - Consistent beat across all interactions
2. **RHYTHM (Composition)** - Composing and storing your own rhythm
3. **BEAT (Performance)** - Freely performing practiced songs

```javascript
// Singer-songwriter's creative process
Touch/Click (TEMPO = Consistent skill anywhere through steady practice)
    ↓
rhythm.click() (RHYTHM = Recording and experience of composed music)
    ↓
BEAT encoding (Real-time performance on stage)
    ↓
Cookie creation (Recording performance session in browser)
    ↓
Edge observation (Livestreaming to audience)
```

### Scenario 1: Daily Busking

**7:00 PM - First Visit (Taking the Stage)**

A user arrives at the site for the first time. The browser is like a singer-songwriter's stage just preparing to perform.

The system first checks for cookies with ping=1. These are traces of ended performances. If found, it cleans the stage. Then it checks for cookies with ping=0 to confirm no performance is in progress.

Creating new rhythm_01 starting with ping=0. This means the singer-songwriter has taken the stage. Edge detects ping=0 and immediately begins livestreaming. This stage's first song begins with the singer-songwriter's signature !home.

```javascript
rhythm_01 = "0_0_0_0_1_1735714800_0_0_0_!home"
```

**7:30 PM - Day One Performance Begins (First Recording)**

Thirty minutes of passionate performance unfold. The user explores 5 pages (performs 5 songs), executes 50 clicks (plucks guitar strings) and 23 scrolls (prompts engagement). Edge's livestreaming captures every moment.

```javascript
rhythm_01 = "0_0_0_0_1_1735714800_1800_50_23_!home~100*3nav1~300!1~50*1~200*2!2~100*15img1..."
```

**8:00 PM - Performance Change (Additional Session from Tab Switch)**

The singer-songwriter changes sessions mid-performance at audience request. Existing rhythm_01 remains, new rhythm_02 is created. Edge's livestreaming records all changes seamlessly. The rhythm_01 session can return anytime.

**10:00 PM - Catching Breath (Additional Session from Capacity Overflow)**

After 2 hours, rhythm_02 exceeds 3.9KB, switching to new rhythm_03. Existing rhythm_01 and rhythm_02 maintain ping=0 state, Edge smoothly streams all transitions.

```javascript
rhythm_01 = "0_0_0_0_1_1735714800_3600_80_40_!home~..."
rhythm_02 = "0_0_0_0_1_1735718400_7200_220_100_!3~..."  
rhythm_03 = "0_0_0_0_1_1735725600_0_0_0_!1"
```

**11:00 PM - Day One Performance Ends (Browser Close)**

Wrapping up busking. Change all rhythm pings from 0 to 1. This means the singer-songwriter leaves the stage. Edge detects ping=1 and ends livestreaming. Today's performance—recording nothing but pure rhythm without IP or names—archives privately or disappears as a one-time performance remaining only briefly in people's memories.

```javascript
rhythm_01 = "1_0_0_0_1_1735714800_3600_80_40_..."
rhythm_02 = "1_0_0_0_1_1735718400_7200_220_100_..."
rhythm_03 = "1_0_0_0_1_1735725600_3600_60_25_..."
```

**Next Day 7:00 PM - Day Two Performance Begins (Second Recording)**

A new day's performance begins. If the system finds cookies with ping=1, it cleanly tidies yesterday's performance spot. After deleting all ping=1 cookies, it creates new rhythm_01 to begin today's performance. Today also opens with the signature song !home.

```javascript
rhythm_01 = "0_0_0_0_1_1735801200_0_0_0_!home"
```

### Scenario 2: Encore on a Rainy Day

**8:30 PM - Passionate Performance (First Recording)**

The performance reaches its peak. The audience is completely captivated by melodies flowing from the singer-songwriter's fingertips. Clicks and scrolls follow the rhythm, BEAT draws complex yet beautiful patterns. Edge streams every moment without missing anything.

```javascript
rhythm_01 = "0_0_0_0_1_1735720800_10800_220_100_!home~30*3nav1~150!1~50*1~20*2~20*3~300!2~180*15div4..."
rhythm_02 = "0_0_0_0_1_1735731600_7200_215_95_!2~25*6div3~200!3~100*4~350!4~50*8span2..."
rhythm_03 = "0_0_0_0_1_1735738800_1800_45_23_!1~80*12button1~50!home~150*5..."
```

**8:35 PM - Performance Interrupted by Downpour (Browser Crash)**

Wind and rain strike without warning, the browser freezes. The performance cannot continue, but cookies remain in the browser at ping=0 state. The audience watching the performance endures the storm, staying in place. Edge cannot record the performance but doesn't stop livestreaming.

```

**8:40 PM - Stage After Rain Clears (Reconnection)**

The user reopens the browser. The system finds cookies with ping=0. These are traces of the interrupted performance. The singer-songwriter sees the audience who stayed through the rain. Moved, the singer-songwriter decides to clean up the existing performance and prepare a special encore for them.

The system changes existing rhythms to ping=1 to finish. Edge detects ping=1, ends existing livestreaming, then archives the interrupted performance privately. It immediately prepares to stream the new encore performance.

```javascript
// Recovery process
rhythm_01 = "1_0_0_0_1_1735720800_11100_235_108_..." // ping 0→1 change
rhythm_02 = "1_0_0_0_1_1735731600_7500_228_102_..." // ping 0→1 change
rhythm_03 = "1_0_0_0_1_1735738800_2100_52_27_..." // ping 0→1 change
// New encore performance begins
rhythm_01 = "0_0_0_0_1_1735740600_0_0_0_!home"
```

**8:45 PM - Encore Performance (Second Recording)**

The singer-songwriter who experienced interruption performs more passionately. Short but dense interactions follow. Faster tempo, deeper clicks, exploring more pages than before. Edge records this special encore with new streaming.

```javascript
// Fast tempo (~20, ~10) rushing clicks → Performance responding to audience cheers
rhythm_01 = "0_0_0_0_1_1735740600_900_89_45_!home~20*1~10*2~30!1~50*15button1~100!2~80*3~20*4..."
```

**9:00 PM - Memorable Performance (Browser Close)**

The encore performance ends. The singer-songwriter takes a final bow and leaves the stage. Today had four performances. Three interrupted performances, one short but perfect encore. Edge treasured every performance in its records.

```javascript
// rhythm_01 = "1_0_0_0_1_1735720800_11100_235_108_..."
// rhythm_02 = "1_0_0_0_1_1735731600_7500_228_102_..."
// rhythm_03 = "1_0_0_0_1_1735738800_2100_52_27_..." // Performance records before browser crash
rhythm_01 = "1_0_0_0_1_1735740600_900_89_45_..." // All performances perfectly recorded
```

Today's performances—recording nothing but pure rhythm without IP or names—each carrying their own stories, archive privately or disappear as special experiences remaining only briefly in people's memories.

## Sixth Movement: Actual Performance and Value

### The Principle of Resonating Strings

Inside a piano lie over 230 strings. Strike one, and others with the same frequency resonate naturally. This is sympathetic resonance.

Web cookies resonate too. With every page request, cookies automatically travel in HTTP headers. No developer instructions needed, no code required—this web resonance phenomenon has continued since 1994.

Traditional analytics tools ignored this natural resonance to build separate synthesizers. They collect data with scripts, transmit via APIs, process on servers.

Full Score tunes this resonance. TEMPO aligns the beat of touches and clicks, RHYTHM records user behavior in the browser, BEAT encodes it into sheet music. The resulting music resonates naturally through the cookie soundboard, and Edge immediately interprets this resonance.

Data isn't collected. It's music already playing in the air.

```javascript
// Concert Hall - Traditional Analytics
tag('event', 'click', {...}); // Active "transmission"

// Street Busking - Full Score  
// No setup needed, cookies automatically "resonate", enabling real-time observation/analysis/judgment
```

### A Perfect Duet Transcending Time

Major concert hall performances require dozens of performers. Each with their instruments, sheet music, conductor, stage equipment, sound systems. But street busking is different. One guitar, one voice is enough.

Traditional analytics is a concert hall performance. Collection servers, processing servers, storage servers, analytics servers each play their parts. Selling tickets, arranging seats, printing programs. Full Score is busking. Compose your own music directly, just need free RHYTHM. The rest was already on the street. The browser stage, HTTP street resonance, Edge's natural and endless amplification.

Cookies were originally made to remember state, Edge was originally made to respond quickly from nearby, browsers could always store data. We just created a stage for them to sing together.

The long-forgotten essence of the web, rediscovered through the metaphor of music in the AI era. Past simplicity and future possibility meet in the present, creating beautiful harmony.

### Time Compression, Behavioral Language in RHYTHM

BEAT transforms time into music. "!home~300*3input1~1200!page~50*button"—this short score captures an hour's journey. 30 seconds of decision is short like staccato, 120 seconds of exploration flows like legato, 5 seconds of clicking is intense like an accent.

What traditional JSON would spread across 100 bytes, compressed to 30 bytes. But this isn't simple compression. Like haiku capturing the universe in 17 syllables, BEAT captures human intent with minimal symbols. Infinite variations of time and action, depth and pattern.

AI likes this score, immediately answering "typical purposeful buyer pattern." With JSON it would first need to open a dictionary, but BEAT reads naturally like music crossing borders.

### Bots and Humans, Metronome and Rubato

Bot clicks are metronomes:
```
Bot: *1a1~10*1a2~10*1a3~10*1a4 (Metronome)
```
Exactly 1 second, exactly same depth. Perfect but dead.

Human clicks are rubato:
```
Human: !home~37*5nav1~3*5nav1~218*12button1~1847!1 (Rubato)
```
3.7 seconds of curiosity, 0.3 seconds of mistake, 21.8 seconds of exploration, 3 minutes of hesitation. Imperfect but alive, like music.

DOM depth also layers like musical harmony. Real buttons usually hide 8 layers deep. From bass lows to violin highs, web pages create different timbres by depth. Bots play only monophony. The shallowest layer, monotonous melody. No harmony, no counterpoint, just mechanical repetition.

AI connected with Edge immediately knows the difference. Average depth below 3 means bot, click interval standard deviation near 0 means bot, no hesitation means bot. Without complex algorithms, just simple rhythm distinguishes authenticity. Like perfect pitch instantly identifying D, AI distinguishes humans and bots through BEAT patterns. Musical intuition reborn as data analysis.

WAF doesn't ignore noisy sounds echoing from BEAT but executes summary judgment. Full Score has sufficient value as a new security layer too.

### Silent Security, Value of Nothingness

Before music begins, the moment of silence as the conductor holds the baton is most important. Full Score is the same.

Since no personal information is collected, there's nothing to leak. With nothing stored on servers, there's nothing to hack. Without network requests, there's nothing to intercept. Hacking Full Score's data means hacking every user's browser visiting the website. Though only simple patterns are recorded, not sensitive personal information (PII).

Faster page loads are just the beginning. The real key is that without requesting or sending data, Edge completes real-time analysis just by listening to RHYTHM already flowing in the air. While traditional tools prepare numerous instruments for collection, transmission, processing, and storage, Full Score quickly begins the next performance.

Cookies automatically disappear after a few days. GDPR risk is much lower than existing analytics tools. Like street music scattering in the wind, data naturally dissipates over time. Free because it doesn't promise eternity.

## Final Movement: Return of the Singer-Songwriter

### The Musician Returns to the Streets

The major agency told the singer-songwriter: "We have a bigger stage prepared for you. The best sound system, dazzling lights, tens of thousands in the audience. With us, you'll be incredibly successful."

But the free-spirited singer-songwriter picked up their guitar and returned to the streets. Finding a corner of the sunlit square, opening the guitar case, tuning the worn guitar. As the first song begins, one or two people stop. The sound of fountain droplets falling. Someone's applause. A child's laughter.

And realized. People genuinely enjoy the performance. What matters isn't the size of the stage but the distance between music and people.

The browser stage was already perfect. No additional installation needed, no complex setup required. HTTP's street resonance never stopped for 30 years, and Edge the best friend always waited in the same place.

### Three Chords, One Song

The singer-songwriter needed just three chords rather than a bigger, fancier stage.

**C Chord - TEMPO**
```javascript
touchend → el.click()  // Instantly responsive fingertips
```

**G Chord - RHYTHM**  
```javascript
document.cookie = `rhythm=${beat}`  // Melody the browser remembers
```

**Am Chord - BEAT**
```javascript
"!home~30*3nav1~120!1~5*1"  // Story carved in time
```

These three chords were enough. And just as countless hits were created riding the rhythm of C-G-Am and F, Full Score meeting Edge discovered infinite possibilities in simplicity.

**Perfect Harmony, F Chord - Edge**
```javascript
request.headers.get('Cookie')  // Beautifully resonating harmony
```

### Music Made with the Audience

The most beautiful moment in a singer-songwriter's performance is when the audience sings along. Full Score also makes music with users.

Every time users click and scroll, BEAT records it. This is music the singer-songwriter cannot make alone. Like how audience response, applause, and singing together complete a real live performance, user interactions complete Full Score.

Now every browser serves like an auxiliary database containing its own music. With each person's rhythm, each person's tempo, each person's story performed.

### The Singer-Songwriter's Final Realization

"When will the next web technology appear?"

The singer-songwriter paused mid-performance. A passing grandmother smiled warmly and said, "Someone played guitar in this same spot when I was young. The music is just as beautiful then as now."

In that moment, realization came.

The guitar in hand was made in the 1980s. Steel strings were invented centuries ago, chord progressions existed since Bach's time. But today, on this street, the music created in this moment is completely new.

```javascript
// past + present = ∞
cookie.meet(edge) // Harmony transcending spacetime
```

The browser was the eternal stage that was always there. Cookies were the music of all musicians who performed on this street, Edge became the channel connecting that music to the world in real-time. AI heard the BEAT created by every user click and scroll, immediately understanding the melody drawn by human behavior.

The singer-songwriter finally realized. New web technology doesn't suddenly appear some future day. When cookies and Edge meet in the AI era, like Bach's fugue meeting jazz swing, harmony transcending time resonates. We just hadn't realized—perfection was always there.

<br />

## And the Harmony Begins

The singer-songwriter strikes a new chord.
The result of practice's TEMPO, composition's RHYTHM, performance's BEAT.

The audacity to eliminate problems rather than add complexity.
The insight to create perfect analytics without servers.
The intuition to understand users without personal information.

Everything is contained within this small Full Score.

## Usage

Full Score is an incredibly lightweight tool. For detailed usage and customization, please refer to the comments in the fullscore.js file. The code works immediately when copied and pasted into your website without any additional configuration.

The BEAT format recorded in browser cookies can be observed and analyzed in Edge Workers at no additional cost. You can limit Edge's role to observation and analysis, while storing behavioral data on your web server or sending it to webhook services like n8n.

For real-time bot detection logic, we recommend implementing it in Edge Workers rather than client-side JavaScript. The Full Score developer is preparing an easy-to-use Edge Worker, and a basic example is available on GitHub for reference.
